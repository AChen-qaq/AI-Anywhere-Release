## Our Journey

ðŸ’¡ The spark: While using ChatGPT to improve grad school applications, we were frustrated by constant copy-pasting and context-switching. That's when we envisioned AI Anywhere â€“ a seamless, efficient, and customizable AI tool that assists users in text editing, coding, and messaging across apps and platforms.

ðŸŒ± As a team of CS undergrads, this is our first product. We are currently beta testing AI Anywhere, and weâ€™re offering it completely FREE with no query limits!ðŸ¤© 

Your feedback is invaluable for improvement, so give it a try and share your thoughts! (Yes, we are aware that there may be bugs, Mac and Windows APIs can be such a painðŸ‘¿).

## Our Vision

We're working on making AI Anywhere a personalized AI assistant that truly understands your unique needs and preferences. Stay updated by following us on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ai-anywhere-beta) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UseAIAnywhere)!
